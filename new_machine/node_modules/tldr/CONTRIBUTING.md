# Contributing

Contribution are most welcome!
We've already accepted a lot of new features, command-line flags, and general bug fixes.

That being said, if it's something sizeable or a brand new feature, it's a good idea to open an issue beforehand to discuss it openly and gather some feedback.

## Dev notes

The best way to submit a change is a pull-request from a feature branch.
Once you've cloned the project:

```bash
$ git checkout -b fix-for-blah
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

Everything should be passing!
Don't forget to keep the tests green on your branch - or to add some where necessary.
